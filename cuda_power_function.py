    """
    This function computes the difference between the proportion of voting power for a locality
    and the proportion of the population that town has.

    Equivalent to `compute_power_cupy_simple` with the exception that the subsets in
    `subset_masks_bool` and `subset_masks_float` assume that one town, in particular, always votes
    in the affirmative. This reduces the memory cost of the computation but otherwise does not
    affect the speed significantly.

    Args:
        u_matrix (cupy.ndarray): Array of size (num_towns, 1) that contains the weights to assign
            to each town.
        subset_masks_bool (cupy.ndarray): Array of size (num_towns, num_subsets) that contains
            boolean masks for whether a town voted in favor of a particular measure. It is assumed
            that one town, in particular, always votes in the affirmative.
        subset_masks_float (cupy.ndarray): Array of size (num_towns, num_subsets) that contains
            the same data as the boolean masks, but as floats for ease of computation.
        T (float): The threshold for the power.

    Returns:
        cupy.ndarray:
            An array of size (num_towns,) that contains the computed voting power for when each
            town is given weight determined by the passed u_matrix.
