    """
    This function computes the difference between the proportion of voting power for a locality
    and the proportion of the population that town has.

    Equivalent to `compute_power_numpy_simple` with the exception that the subsets in `subset_masks`
    assumes that one town, in particular, always votes in the affirmative. This reduces the
    memory cost of the computation but otherwise does not affect the speed significantly.

    Args:
        u_matrix (numpy.ndarray): Array of size (num_towns, 1) that contains the weights to assign
            to each town.
        subset_masks (numpy.ndarray): Array of size (num_towns, num_subsets) that contains
            boolean masks for whether a town voted in favor of a particular measure. Note:
            it is generally assumed that one town, in particular, always votes in the affirmative
            in this version.
        T (float): The threshold for the power.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray:
            An array of size (num_towns,) that contains the computed voting power for when each
            town is given weight determined by the u_matrix.
