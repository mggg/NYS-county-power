    This function computes the difference between the proportion of voting power for a locality
    and the proportion of the population that town has.

    Args:
        m (numpy.ndarray): An array of size (1, num_towns) that contains the proportion of the
            population that each town has (this vector must sum to 1).
        u_matrix (numpy.ndarray): Array of size (num_towns, 1) that contains the weights to assign
            to each town.
        subset_masks (numpy.ndarray): Array of size (num_towns, num_subsets) that contains
            boolean masks for whether a town voted in favor of a particular measure.
        T (float): The threshold for the power.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray:
            An array of size (num_towns,) that contains the difference between the computed voting
            power for when each town is given weight determined by the u_matrix and the proportion
